# Ludum Dare 30 - Connected Worlds

My submission for the LudumDare30 GameMaking Competition.

Play it over at http://www.thomaschapeaux.be/ld30-connected-worlds

The theme was "Connected Worlds" and my game is called "Universal Remote". The player is given a remote consisting of a grid of on/off buttons which affect four different worlds at the same time.

As per the competition's rules, the whole thing was done in less than 48 hours (and actually much less).
